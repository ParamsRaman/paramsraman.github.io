<p>With the recent hype around Deep Learning and easily accessible machine learning libraries/toolkits, etc there is a rising
question whether part of machine learning is slowly turning into a set of pluggable software modules and engineering artifacts, which a person (even without a domain knowledge) can come in and make use of, to solve his specific applcations. This also relates to the frequently asked questions about building “data science” experts. Several courses, certifications exist online which are geared towards covering some of these toolkits and basic algorithms to get you upto speed into this field, and apply them to problems to your choice. While I feel, such wide-spread coverage on Artificial Intelligence and the success of Deep Learning methods are certainly helping in bringing the field into the much needed global limelight, I also feel that the world is rushing into making several hasty conclusions (cite KDD talk). I also frequently hear the questions about the role of scientist vs engineers in Machine Learning. My goal in this post is to discuss some of my thoughts on these through some analogies (I am a big fan of analogies!).</p>
