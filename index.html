<!--h2>Bio</h2-->
<p align="justify"> I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon. My
  research interests lie at the intersection of <b>Optimization</b> and
  <b>Large-Scale Machine Learning</b>, with applications in areas such as
  <i>Ranking, Recommender Systems</i>, <i> Extreme Classification</i> (multi-class or multi-label 
  involving huge number of data points and classes/labels), <i>Extreme
    Clustering</i> (huge number of
  data points and clusters) and <i>Deep Learning</i>. Other interests
  include <b>Scalable Bayesian Inference</b> for <b> Graphical Models</b>. 

<br><br>
My PhD thesis work has focussed on:
<ul>
  <li> Developing reformulations for a wide spectrum of frequentist and bayesian models 
    to help distribute computation across machines more efficiently (de-centralize both data as well as
    model parameters simultaneously to achieve <i>Hybrid Parallelism</i>) by using novel algorithmic/statistical/computational techniques, 
  <li> Developing and implementing "asynchronous" distributed stochastic optimizers to solve the reformulations.
</ul>

I have experience designing and implementing parallel optimization/inference algorithms 
in distributed memory settings, for a variety of large-scale
supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.<br><br>

I am very excited about applying advances from algorithms/numerical linear
algebra and systems/high-performance computing areas to develop computationally
efficient machine learning algorithms that can deal with massive
datasets.<br><br>

During the course of my PhD, I have also spent wonderful summers interning at
<i>LinkedIn</i> (2014), <i>Microsoft Research CISL Lab</i> (2015), <i>Adobe
  Research</i> (2016) and <i>Amazon AI</i> (2017) working on diverse interesting problems in machine learning. 
Before joining my Ph.D., I worked at <i>Yahoo!</i> (2011-2013) in the Personalization
  Group on applying machine learning and NLP to Entity Matching, Entity Extraction and Knowledge Graph problems. 
  I got my masters degree in Computer Science at <i>Georgia
    Tech</i> (2011). I worked in the Sonification Lab of Georgia Tech, with
  Prof. Bruce Walker in developing auditory and non-traditional interfaces for Human Computer Interaction.
