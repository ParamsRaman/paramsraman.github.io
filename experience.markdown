**Industry**  
At Amazon, I worked on efficient algorithms and distributed methods for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs. Before that, I worked in the personalization org at Yahoo! on developing machine learning models for Entity Matching, Entity Detection and built a Knowledge Graph from scratch to power Yahoo! websites. Prior to that, I worked at ThoughtWorks as a Software Developer.

**Internships**  
During my PhD internships, I have worked on search relevance, learning to rank, recommender systems, text and document analysis and user behavior clustering.

My PhD research focussed on designing efficient distributed stochastic optimization algorithms for large-scale machine learning problems such as *Extreme classification* (multi-class/multi-label with large # labels and data points), *Extreme clustering* (mixture models with large # classes and data points) and *Scalable robust learning to rank* (large # of users and items). I have experience in implementing parallel, asynchronous optimization algorithms in distributed memory settings (using C++, MPI) for a variety of machine learning models.

During my Masters, I worked in the Sonification Lab of Georgia Tech, with Prof Bruce Walker in developing non-traditional interfaces for Human Computer Interaction. Prototyped tools and contributed to research of Auditory Menus. Used affect-detection libraries (machine learning to detect mood of the drivers) as part of a Next-Gen In Vehicle Interface project. Participated in lab-demos, poster-presentations and co-authored four publications. During my Undergrad, I worked on developing efficient Caching Algorithms for Location-Dependent Data.
