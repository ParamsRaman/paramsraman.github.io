<Work Summary - Sonification Lab>

Overall:
- Participated in lab demos, GVU poster sessions, Radio Recording sessions, initial visits to Shepherd Center about IVAT.
- Contributed as an author in three publications:
  * ICAD 2010 - Reducing repetitive development tasks in auditory menu displays with the auditory menu library - (Parameswaran Raman, Benjamin K. Davison, Myounghoon Jeon, Bruce N. Walker)
  * CSUN 2010 - Advanced Auditory Menus for Universal Access to Electronic Devices  - (Myounghoon Jeon, Benjamin K. Davison, Jeff Wilson, Parameswaran Raman, Bruce N. Walker)

Auditory Menus Project:
- Worked on prototype to demonstrate the various AM features, came up with a Java based Desktop application that was used for lab demos.
- Worked with Ben on Auditory Menu Library and representing AM's using yaml markup. Led to a GVU poster and an ICAD 2010 publication.

IVAT Project:
- Initially worked with Kedar in understanding Centrafuse platform and fixing the plugin architecture.
- Worked with Centrafuse team and automated the process of generating, compiling and deploying plugins (using C# Visual Studio).
- Trained and helped new lab members understand creating Centrafuse plugins.
- Integrated Affect Detection into Centrafuse. Participated in related lab demos.

ENGIN Project:
- Brainstormed on initial ideas for the Next Gen Interface, created surveys, gathered information from friends, did polls to find out what people think about new features of an in-vehicle interface.
- Discussed with rest of the team and categorized these ideas into common groups, held expert sessions I and II with human factor experts, analyzed their feedback and worked on refining the ideas. Prepared more detailed UI flows for some of them.
- Ran FGI sessions with Philart for gathering more information.
- Presented the initial ENGIN designs to Panasonic with Bruce/Philart and others.
- Appeared as poster in Auto UI Conf 2011.

MathAIG Project:
- Worked with Prof. Susan Embretson and her students in understanding requirements for this project. Put together a web-based application based on Google GWT.
- Created a more generic design later (to accommodate all her question variants). Came up with a desktop based app with a database design to support more advanced combinations of questions.
- Worked with Jeff Wilson towards the end to transfer the work.

People I collaborated with:
- Bruce, Ben, Philart, Jeff Wilson, Susan Embretson, Kedar, Centrafuse team
