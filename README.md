Source Code for my homepage
=========================

This is source code for my academic [homepage](http://people.ucsc.edu/~praman1/).

Special thanks to [Sangjin Han](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sangjin/) for sharing his website template and letting me re-use it. Extending his help, I have also made my code available on github.

Feel free to copy this webpage and customize it for your own:

1. Install Jekyll.
2. Modify the contents.
3. Run Jekyll.
4. Copy the result in \_site/ to your web server
(You might need to tweak the "deploy.sh" file a bit)
