    <p id="abstract2" style="display:none;"><small>Distributed parameter
      estimation algorithms in machine learning follow two main flavors: data parallel, where the data is
      distributed across multiple workers and model parallel, where the model
      parameters are partitioned across multiple workers. The main limitation of
      the first approach is that the model parameters need to be replicated on
      every machine. This is problematic when the number of parameters is very
      large, and hence cannot fit in a single machine. This drawback of the
      latter approach is that the data needs to be replicated on each machine.
      In this thesis, I will present Hybrid-Parallelism, an approach that allows
      us to partition both, the data as well as the model parameters
      simultaneously. As a result, each worker only needs access to a subset of
      the data and a subset of the parameters while performing parameter
      updates. I will present case studies concerning popular models: (1)
      Multinomial Logistic Regression (2) Mixture of Exponential Families,
      (3) Latent Collaborative Retrieval, and (4) Factorization Machines. In all cases, 
      I will show how to exploit the access pattern of parameter updates to derive Hybrid-Parallel asynchronous algorithms.

    <p id="abstract2" style="display:none;"><small>We study the problem of
      scaling Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) to datasets with very large
      number of data points in the presence of large number of classes. At a
    scale where neither data nor the parameters are able to fit on a single
    machine, we argue that "simultaneous data and model parallelism (Hybrid
  Parallelism)" is inevitable. The key challenge in achieving such a form of
  parallelism in MLR is the log-partition function which needs to be computed
"across all K classes" per data point, thus making model parallelism
non-trivial. To overcome this problem, we propose a reformulation of the
original objective that exploits "double-separability", an attractive property
that naturally leads to hybrid parallelism. Our algorithm (DS-MLR) is
"asynchronous and completely de-centralized", requiring minimal communication
across workers while keeping both data and parameter workloads partitioned.
Unlike standard data parallel approaches, DS-MLR "avoids bulk-synchronization" by maintaining local normalization terms on each worker and accumulating them incrementally using a token-ring topology. We demonstrate the versatility of DS-MLR under various scenarios in data and model parallelism, through an empirical study consisting of real-world datasets. In particular, to demonstrate scaling via hybrid parallelism, we created a new benchmark dataset (Reddit-Full) by pre-processing 1.7 billion reddit user comments spanning the period 2007-2015. We used DS-MLR to solve an extreme multi-class classification problem of classifying 211 million data points into their corresponding subreddits. Reddit-Full is a massive data set with data occupying 228 GB and 44 billion parameters occupying 358 GB. To the best of our knowledge, no other existing methods can handle MLR in this setting. </small></p>

    <p id="abstract1" style="display:none;"><small>Mixture of exponential family models are among the most fundamental and widely used
  statistical models. Stochastic variational inference
  (SVI), the state-of-the-art algorithm for parameter estimation in such models is inherently 
  serial. Moreover, it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single processor;
  this poses serious limitations on scalability when the number of parameters 
  is in billions. In this paper, we present extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), a
  distributed, asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference
  for mixture models on massive real world datasets. ESVI
  overcomes the limitations of SVI by requiring that each processor only
  access a subset of the data and a subset of the parameters, thus
  providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. Our empirical study demonstrates
  that ESVI not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time, but also
  achieves a better quality solution. 
  To further speed up computation and save memory when fitting large
  number of topics, we propose a variant ESVI-TOPK which maintains only the top-k important topics.
  Empirically, we found that using top 25% topics suffices to achieve the same accuracy as storing all the topics.</small></p>

    <p id="abstract3" style="display:none;"><small>We propose RoBiRank - a Learning to Rank algorithm inspired by Robust Binary Classification and show that it scales well on large-data. The main idea behind Robust Binary Classification is to use transformation on convex losses to help give up performance on hard to classify data points (outliers). <u>Firstly</u>, we observe that this is related to learning to rank, where we would not mind sacrificing accuracy at the bottom of the ranking list in order to gain performance at top of the list. We thus show that our ranking objective function can be viewed as a generalization of robust binary classification. <u>Secondly</u>, minimizing RoBiRank is equivalent to directly maximizing DCG (a popular evaluation metric for listwise learning to rank). As a result, RoBiRank performs really well at the top of the list. <u>Thirdly</u>, using a linearization trick on our loss allows us to obtain an unbiased stochastic gradient estimator so that our SGD optimizer becomes independent of the size of the dataset. In addition, our algorithm is parallelizable and can also be used to solve large-scale problems without any explicit features. Experimental results are shown on both medium and very large datasets.</small></p>

    <p id="abstract4" style="display:none;"><small>Thomson problem is a classical problem in physics to study how
n number of charged particles distribute themselves on the surface of a sphere of k dimensions. When k=2, i.e. a 
2-sphere (a circle), the particles appear at equally spaced points. Such a configuration can be computed analytically. 
However, for higher dimensions such as k >= 3, i.e. the case of 3-sphere
(standard sphere),  there is not much that is understood analytically. Finding global minimum of the problem under 
these settings is particularly tough since the optimization problem becomes increasingly computationally
intensive with larger values of such as k and n.  In this work, we explore a wide variety of numerical optimization 
methods to solve the Thomson problem. In our empirical study, we find stochastic gradient based methods (SGD) 
to be a compelling choice for this problem as it scales well with the number of points.</small></p>

    <p id="abstract5" style="display:none;"><small> Micro-blogging has become
      increasingly popular in recent
      years. Using micro-blogging in a large classroom could be
      beneficial for learning. However, sometimes addressing the
      large number of posts could be cumbersome to a reader who
      has only limited time in a classroom. We propose a novel
      solution for predicting the relevancy of a question asked in a
      class by looking at the questions asked in previous semesters,
      the similarity of the question to the lecture material, as well
      as a set of question features such as the number of students’ votes,
      number of replies, the length of the question,
      and whether it was asked anonymously. To identify similar
      questions asked previously, topic modeling and feature selection are used.
      Empirical results show that topic modeling
      leads to better prediction performance score as compared to
      feature selection. The similarity of the question and its corresponding
      lecture material further improves the relevancy
      prediction of the questions.

      machine learning techniques to the game of cricket for target prediction in case
      of interruption to the game. We first evaluate and identify some of the
      shortcomings of the predominantly used Duckworth - Lewis method (D/L) for
      target prediction. The data for this was obtained by crawling websites
      which maintain statistics of cricket matches in the past and selected a set of
      features which are most likely to affect the outcome of the game. Then, we ran
      feature estimation algorithms to identify the important features that help in
      target prediction. Then we discuss how the some of the shortcomings of D/L method
      can be overcome with Machine Learning ideas. Then we discuss Regression
      type algorithms which perform as well as D/L method but also take into
      consideration some of the features that D/L overlooks. Then we provide a
      framework to compare the target prediction algorithms with one another.
      Finally we discuss the results of the Machine Learning algorithm against
      benchmarks and ways to enhance the prediction models.</small></p>

    <p id="abstract10" style="display:none;"><small> Autism Spectrum Disorders
      (ASD) are developmental disabilities characterized by difficulties with
      social interactions, impairment in verbal and/or nonverbal communication,
      and the development of repetitive, unusual, or highly-specialized
      interests. The main symptoms of ASD are particular social and language
      problems. Often, children with ASDs will have delays developing spoken
      language. Currently, language delays are the symptom that most commonly
      captures the attention of parents or pediatricians and, consequently,
      children are infrequently diagnosed before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recent
      estimates for all ASDs combined tend to fall between 20 and 80 per 10,000.
      [1] Unquestionably, there are more children being diagnosed with ASD today
      than ever before. This, in and of itself, presents a major public health
      challenge. We hypothesize that some individuals on the autism spectrum exhibit a bias
      towards using visual instead of verbal mental representations for various
      tasks. This "thinking in pictures" form of cognition has been
      introspectively reported by many individuals on the autism spectrum, such
      as Temple Grandin, a high-functioning adult with autism who has written
      several books touching on this notion. [2] We believe, the adaptive
      keyboard with its dynamic display keys can augment communication in non-verbal 
			children with autism disorder spectrum. The dynamic display feature of the keys enable programming
      contextual visual cues that can augment communication. A collection of
      visual cues and natural language processing algorithms work in combination
      to allow a child to communicate with peers and adults.</small></p>

    <p id="abstract11" style="display:none;"><small> Caching frequently accessed
      items on the mobile client is an important technique to enhance data
      availability and to improve data access time. Cache replacement policies
      are used to find a suitable subset of items for eviction from the cache
      due to limited cache size. The existing policies rely on Euclidean space
      and consider Euclidean distance as an important parameter for eviction.
      However, in practice the position and movement of objects are constrained
      to spatial networks where the important distance measure is the network
      distance. In this paper we propose a cache replacement policy, which
      considers the network density, network distance and probability of access
      as important factors for eviction. We make use of an already proven
      technique called Progressive incremental network expansion to compute the
      network distance more efficiently. A series of simulation experiments have
      been conducted to evaluate the performance of the policy. Results indicate
      that the proposed cache replacement scheme performs significantly better
      than the existing policies FAR and PAID and WPRRP.</small></p>
